# Introduction {#Introduction}
vmmlib - a templatized C++ vector and matrix math library

VMMLib includes a vector and a matrix class, with additional
functionality for the often-used 3d and 4d vectors and 3x3 and 4x4
matrices. More advanced features include solvers, frustum computations
and frustum culling classes and spatial data structures

VMMLib is implemented using C++ templates, making it versatile. Being a
header library, it is very easy to integrate into other (your) libraries
and programs. There is no need to build and install a library, just
include the headers and youâ€™re set. The BSD license allows the usage
both in open source and commercial closed source software.
